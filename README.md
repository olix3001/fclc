# FCLC (Fast Code Line Counter)
FCLC is a program similar to cloc which it is also inspired by.

When using cloc I discovered that It is not the fastest and lacks some features.
FCLC is in a very early development stage!

## Features
- Total lines count
- Empty lines count
- Code lines count
- Automatic exclusion of unwanted directories (like node_modules)
- Fast!!!
